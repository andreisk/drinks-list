Armagnac,"Chateau de Pellehaut ""K&L Exclusive - L'Age de Glace"" Ténarèze Armagnac (750ml)"," 
                                                        Chateau Pellehaut has been one of our top direct imports for the past year here at K&L. We've visited the Ténarèze producer twice over the past few years, always finding something new to bring home for our brandy fans. What really excited us this year, however, was a new project they were working on called L'Age de Glace: a young brandy meant to drink on the rocks (hence the name ""Ice Age""). The fruit of the Armagnac takes center stage here, melding wonderfully with the small hint of vanilla from the wood. It's all distilled from Folle Blanche fruit and ...

                                                        On a beautifully situated property overlooking the town of Montréal-du-Gers, lies the Château de Pellehaut. Purchased by Gaston Béraut shortly after the Second World War, he has slowly developed one of the largest single properties in the region.  Béraut's sons Mathieu and Martin take care of winemaking (the red, white and rose are all big sellers at K&L) and the élevage of Armagnac. Both are intelligent and enthusiastic about their product, and between them have studied enology in Toulouse and apprenticed at Chateau de Tariquet in Eauze, Chateau Beychev...

Armagnac,"Darroze Les Grand Assemblages ""20 Year Old"" Bas-Armagnac (750ml)"," Absolutely stunning Armagnac with incredible richness, spice, and balance. I can't say it enough, so I'll say it again: every Bourbon drinker who's out there chasing things like Pappy 20 or BMH 16 should be stocking up on things like this instead. Or maybe I shouldn't say that because the people who actually drink Armagnac regularly will get pissy. In any case, this is a slam dunk spirit. Big wood, lots of spice and vanilla, and a rustic fruit character with seamless execution. My new favorite brandy for the moment. (David Driscoll, K&L Spirits Buyer) ",$99.99 
Armagnac,1993 Chateau de la Grangerie 23 Year Old K&L Exclusive Armagnac (750ml)," 
                                                        Chateau de la Grangerie is a property that was built in the 17th century right next to an old monastery. The church and the housing for its servants was actually built in the 11th and 12th centuries and since the Armagnac is aged inside that facility, it might be the only spirit at K&L matured on hallowed grounds. Like many Tenereze producers, Grangerie distills only ugni blanc for its brandies. However, the sandy and gravel-rich soils are much more like the terrain found in the Bas-Armagnac. They fill about ten barrels a year; two of which are used for ...

There reason for that is that it's made in a completely different way from its many counterparts. Double distilled from 100% Colombard on Alembic pot stills, this would normally be absolute sacrilege, but in the case of creating a refined, expressive and usable Blanche it's the perfect choice. Colombard's light fragrant distillate and the extreme balance achieved through the copper pot distillation sets this special brandy apart from its competitors. We've never cared for Blanche A...

Even with the newly constructed distillery, where the Russell's (Jimmy, Eddie, and Bruce) produce the most efficient and consistent whiskey they possible can, they refuse to give up certain practices that they believe to be crucial to the character and quality of the special Wild Turkey legacy.

Light and ethereal, it does not come off as soapy or overly aromatic. In addition, the use of cochineal for coloring means that no artiifical dye is needed, but of course your aviations won't be that brilliant sky blue either.

Only four main botanical flavors are used, some from the Occitan Alps, hence the name. The four are angelica, juniper, cardamom and a secret ingredient (with traces of orange and lemon peel). Occitan Gin has traditionally been made exclusively from juniper that grows wild (not cultivated) in the Maritime Alps, near Cuneo, which are some of the highest mountains in Europe.

This bottle was tagged by the master distiller with the wording ""plus five"" (as there was a greater intensity of five of the ten botanicals) and for this reason the name Piùcinque was naturally born.

Nearly twenty years later, they’re still making Irish whiskey, and they’re still doing it their way.  Made by Coole...

Campbeltown, once the center of whisky production for Scotland, had been hit hard over the last century and had dwindled down to two distilleries - Springbank and Glen Scotia. When the SWA threatened to take away the Campbeltown appellation, Springbank was told a region needed at least three distilleries to consider itself a specific locale. The decision was then made to reopen the long-dormant Gl...

Malt,Douglas Laing's Scallywag 13 Year Old Limited Edition Speyside Blended Malt Scotch Whisky (750ml) (Elsewhere $80)," 
                                                        The Scallywag blended malt has been well received by Scotch lovers and critics alike for its elegance and nuance. It's a blend of the great Speyside distilleries, like Macallan, Mortlach, Glenrothes and many more. Typically a small amount of sherried whisky is included in the blend with the majority coming from refill hogsheads and bourbon barrels. The Limited Edition Scallywag, however, has spent 13 long years entirely in Sherry butts from Jerez. It is indeed what some might term as Sherry forward, yet it wouldn't rank a true bomb thanks to its eminent ...

Rum,Smith & Cross Traditional Jamaica Rum Plummer & Wedderburn Pure Pot Still (750ml),"95 points Wine Enthusiast: ""A top pick for tiki and tropical drinks, this practically begs for lime juice. Scented with warm honey notes, the palate shows lots of brown sugar and spice, plus an enticingly untamed, funky finish (the fabled 'hogo'). Since it’s 'Navy Strength,' you might not want to sip it straight up—the producer wisely recommends exploring the profile first in a daiquiri—though it’s smooth and interesting enough if you want to try.""

A few years back, David Souza, whose family has farmed in the region for a hundred years, decided to add a still to preserve the unused harvest (just like farmers have been doing for hundreds of years) and Corbin Sweet Potato Vodka was born. It turns out that Corbin hasn't only been distilling sweet potato vodka over the past few years; they've also been growing, harvesting, fermenting and distilling their own rye, purchasing custom-charred, 53 gallon white...

This release was distilled in a small copper pot still at Anchor's distillery on San Francisco's Potrero Hill, from a mash of 100% rye malt. Rye was the grain of choice for America's first distillers, and using a mash of 100% rye malt produces a uniquely American whiskey. Aging in handmade oak barrels--lightly toasted in the traditional manner--imparts a wonderfully subtle flavor to this 18th-century-style American whiskey. (In the 18th centur...

                                                        The Arette Reposado is my absolute favorite tequila.  It isn't the best I've ever tasted, but it is my favorite.  Here's why: it smells like fresh agave, despite the barrel aging, which only adds baking spices to the background of the bouquet.  It is simultaneously graceful, yet spicy upon the first sip.  It balances the bridge between smooth sipper and bright shooter like no other tequila...
